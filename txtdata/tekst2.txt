A programming language is a means for building abstractions. Instead of doing tedious
manual work, a programmer can write code once and treat that code as a reusable unit.
Code can be executed repeatedly in a loop; or, code can be grouped as a unit and given
a name as a function; or, using conditionals, the same code can do different things in
different circumstances.
